# Feature Engineering
**Feature Engineering** is a process where we modulate the inputs into entities which can be understood by the algorithm. It is a method of extracting the features from raw data and check how the features work with the ML model and redo the process until the accuracy of the model is improved.<br>

###### Feature engineering also includes:<br>
* Combining features to create a useful feature.
* Removing unwanted features as they may decrease the performance of the model.<br>

The efficiency of an algorithm depends on the features that the model deals. So the prime concern for training any model begins with  feature engineering.

# Epochs<br>
An epoch is one complete presentation of the data-set that has to be learned by a training model. One epoch consists of one full training cycle of the data-set to be trained, after each sample in the set is trained, the process starts again marking the start of the second epoch.<br>
###### Example: 
Consider an image data set containing 50000 images and having a batch size of 500, each iteration would process 500 images for a total of 100 iterations to learn the entire data set. This is counted as _one epoch_.

A programmer cannot be sure about the right number of epochs for any data-set as it varies from each type of data-set. The epochs count can be decreased if the model improves its efficiency over the training cycle.

# How to create an account in Github and upload your first project.

Github is a **distributed version control system** that allows a group of people to work on the same code at the same time , and without stepping on each other's toes. With over 10 million users it is one of the fastest growing community for developers.<br>

5. Once you are done with this step you will be on the main page where you can create your project by clicking on **Start a project**.
![start](https://www.anonfiles.cc/uploads/a2699abf0bf2dde171e89d539bf91623.png "start the project")
7. In the next page, add the repository name, description and make sure you check on **Initialize this repository with a README** and click on **Create repository**
![repository](https://www.anonfiles.cc/uploads/d23a1f32b8044bec86078543c1725710.png "creating repository")
## Upload files
1. After the repository is created you can upload your project files by clicking on **Upload files**.
![upload](https://www.anonfiles.cc/uploads/cc9f377ac9a7f18401322752062a4cf2.png "Uploading files")
2.Upload your files by dragging and dropping them. Next, add the commit message and click on **Commit changes**
![commit](https://www.anonfiles.cc/uploads/286383c1d3855c84564f0a1a7bdbccee.png "Commit changes")
3. You are done. Now all your project files are available in your repository and you can share them by clicking on **Clone or Download** and you get the git clone link or the files can also be downloaded in zip format.
